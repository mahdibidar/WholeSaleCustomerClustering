# WholeSaleCustomerClustering
In this Project we will apply different clustring techniques including KMeans, DBSCAN and Gausian Mixture to cluster the data about annual expenditure on products including Fresh product, Milk, Grocery, Frozen and Detergent/paper products.
But before that we will explore the data inorder to unearth some insights, clean the data, detect and remove the outliers using different techniques including Quantile.
We then will proceed dimenssional reduction process. Then the processed data will go through the clustering.
